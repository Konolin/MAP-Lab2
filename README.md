# Music Library App

A collaborative project developed for the Advanced Programming Methods course, a digital music library. 
This Java-based application lets users follow and listen to their favorite artists, while providing administrative control over app data. 
Leveraging Spring and connecting to a MySQL database, it offers both shell and REST service options.
